Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is coming soon! Stay tuned.

For now, check out our [examples](https://github.com/bitquid-labs/Bitcoin-Bangkok-hacker-house/tree/main/bqjs/test) for sample usage.

# Getting Started

### Import the SDK

Begin by importing the necessary modules from the SDK:

```javascript
import { ClientConfig } from "bqjs";
```

### Create a client instance

Set up the client instance by specifying your client name and ID cover. You can get the Cover IDs [here](https://github.com/bitquid-labs/Bitcoin-Bangkok-hacker-house/tree/main/bqjs#network-cover-ids)

```javascript
const protocolName = "Lorenzo Smart Contract";
const coverId = 21000001;

const client = new ClientConfig(protocolName, coverId);
```

### Retrieve Cover Information

Before every user cover purchase , retrieve the current cover details, including the maximum available amount:

```javascript
const coverInfo = await client.coverInfo();
```

This returns a CoverInfo object containing key details like the risk, capacity, cost, and maximum available coverage.

```javascript
return {
  id: Number(coverInfo[0]),
  name: coverInfo[1],
  risk: Number(coverInfo[2]),
  chains: coverInfo[3],
  capacity: Number(coverInfo[4]),
  cost: Number(coverInfo[5]),
  capacityAmount: Number(coverInfo[6]),
  coverValues: Number(coverInfo[7]),
  maxAmount: Number(coverInfo[8]),
  poolId: Number(coverInfo[9]),
  cid: coverInfo[10],
};
```

### Purchase Insurance Cover

This function be called to purchase cover for the client. Takes the cover value, the cover period and the cover fee (to be changed).

```javascript
let hash = await client.userPurchaseCover(1000000000000000, 120, 10000);
```

It returns the tx hash of the cover purchase tx.
